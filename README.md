WizardPortals
=============

### Description

A standalone portals plugin that can use the WorldEdit wand for selections.

### Extra Notes

This development is mainly for the benifit of the [Worldwide Minecraft Alliance](http://wma.im), an Australian multi-feature server hosted in Sydney, Australia. However, if you'd like to use the plugin on your own server, then by all means go ahead. There currently are no compiled builds of this version, so you will need to compile it yourself.

### Required for Compiling

Install Maven 3

Check out this repo and run: mvn clean install
